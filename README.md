## My process

Created the design with a mobile first approach and took care of the JS code for the interactive icons, once that was done, added the media queries to adapt the design for larger screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I want to improve my JS skills as I'm sure there might be some better approaches to solve this challenge.
